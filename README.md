# 06-Juicy-Breakout

This project was created for a C220 Game Technology class at Indiana University using GDScript in Godot. A simple brick breaker game was provided. This project allowed us to practice added "juicy" features to a game in Godot based on the 2012 GDC presentation, "Juice it or Lose it." The changes listed below were all adapted. The music and sound affects were found from royalty free websites, and the paddle animation was created in Photoshop. 

1. Changed the color of the paddle, ball, and blocks
2. Animated how to blocks and paddle appear on screen
3. Added squeezing and stretching of the paddle
4. Made the blocks fall off the screen when they are hit 
5. Made the blocks rotate as they are hit
6. Made the ball wobble when it hits something
7. Made the ball change color when it hits something
8. Added particles when a block is hit
9. Added a comet trail to the ball
10. Made the tiles shake when the ball hits the paddle
11. Applied screen shake 
12. Added sound effects 
13. Added music 
14. Added eyes to the paddle
15. Made the eyes follow the ball
16. Added mouth to the paddle and animate it
